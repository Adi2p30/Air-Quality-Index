Update on 20th August 2022 (20/08/22)

This week I will try to put data into a spreadsheet and try to make use of features implemented and formulae to find a statistic of air quality and an index that will rate the data based off of my understanding.

The site to the spreadhsheet is:

I have found out factors affecting Air Quality from viable resources and I will be checking those to find fluctions in air quality in Pashan
I will be looking for a defined method to do so by the end of this week

Coming to the conclusion that Pashan might be one of the less affected areas by cultural events and air quality in general. Decided to take up a city like Mumbai instead. I will be making another sheet on the google spreadsheet.

I made a table with all the averages of the years and the 5 year average of the composition of pollutents in the air. 
I also cleaned the data by removing imcomplete data rows

*Major Updates*
I worked on analysing data that pertained to which cities have the most extreme amounts of air quality change.
I will be working/analysing those cities which have the most extreme amounts of air quality change.
