## Introduction
In the data there will be four attributes of air pollution that I will be looking for are (pm25, pm10, no2, co)
pm25(pm2.5): fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller
pm10: inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller

## Factors I will be checkcing
The factors I will be checking to find fluction in levels of air pollution will be based off of the following- 
1. Temperature 
2. Sunlight 
4. Rain 
5. Cultural and Social Events 
6. Power plants in that area 
7. Humidity 
8. Wind 
9. Transportation


Aim:- To analyse and inspect air quality fluctuation in India.


Initial Hypothesis:
It is believed that festivals in india have a major contribution to poor air quality in certain cities of India.
I want to analyse which festivals might and what other factors may affect air quality in those times 
I will be checking for the following fesitvals.
1. Diwali 

Conclusion:- 

 
Result:-
