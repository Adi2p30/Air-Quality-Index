# Introduction
I started with Pashan because of the simple fact that I live in Pashan. Fortunately, there is a reliable data source that provides data for air quality in Pashan.  
My intial view is that air quality is descent there are some days and some places that might have very bad air. I cycle a lot and so I have a good idea of when and where the air quality is sub par.

**Though, I will try my best to make a non-biased report on my findings.**
